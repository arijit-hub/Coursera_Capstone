I have been hired by a startup called Helping You Move based in the city of Toronto. They help people move to similar places to their current location when they wish.
I was handed in the task to provide a cluster of simmilar localities in the city based on simmilar location near each neighbourhoods. The manager has told me that there are
mainly 5 clusters of neighbourhood that I need to find similarity and has told me that their client base finds satisfaction if the locations are quite similar around 500m area.
